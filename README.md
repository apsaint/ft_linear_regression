# ft_linear_regression
An introduction to machine learning

## Environment
The project has been done in python with poetry configuration and dependencies management.

## Project

The project contains 3 programs:

    - Trainer:
    The training program evaluates the price of a car compared to its mileage. 
    Based on the data.csv, it turns the model into a regression. The model is 
    represent by 4 graphs.

    - Estimate:
    The estimate program is used after one training. The program calculates the price of
    a car base on the mileage given by the user.

    - Precision:
    The precision program consists of calculating the accuracy of the training program.

## Tests

The project contains a full tests directory. Every important function are tested. We are using pytest.
